Meeting Week 2:
Notetaker: Mayte Steeghs
No Chairperson: Everyone was present.

We went over logistical details of how the lab meetings will be set up.
We need to set a chairperson and notetaker as a group, they don’t need to rotate.
Notes and Agenda needs to be uploaded every week before the next meeting.
Code contribution should be equal among group members, each person should develop at least two microservices.

Deadline 1: 2nd December for the Draft Architecture 
Final Deadline Assignment 1: Architecture 16 December

Two draft microservices are available on brightspace. This gives us an indication on how they should communicate.
TODO: Read the scenario and finalise requirements. 
TODO: Formulate these into issues on Gitlab
TODO: Setup CI/CD pipeline

Question: do we need to contribute equally every single week? 
Answer: yes, but it doesn’t have to be perfectly equal every week.

We have decided as a group
Chairperson: Ivo
Notetaker: Anton
