Meeting Week 2:
Notetaker: Mayte Steeghs <br>
No Chairperson: Everyone was present. <br>

We went over logistical details of how the lab meetings will be set up. <br>
We need to set a chairperson and notetaker as a group, they don’t need to rotate. <br>
Notes and Agenda needs to be uploaded every week before the next meeting. <br>
Code contribution should be equal among group members, each person should develop at least two microservices. <br>

Deadline 1: 2nd December for the Draft Architecture <br>
Final Deadline Assignment 1: Architecture 16 December <br>

Two draft microservices are available on brightspace. This gives us an indication on how they should communicate.
- [ ] TODO: Read the scenario and finalise requirements. 
- [ ] TODO: Formulate these into issues on Gitlab
- [ ] TODO: Setup CI/CD pipeline

Question: do we need to contribute equally every single week? <br>
Answer: yes, but it doesn’t have to be perfectly equal every week. <br>

We have decided as a group <br>
Chairperson: Ivo <br>
Notetaker: Anton <br>
