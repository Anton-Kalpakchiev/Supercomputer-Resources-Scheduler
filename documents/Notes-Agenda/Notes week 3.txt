 - Ivo telling the TA what we did last week
	- meeting after last week's lab
	- meeting this Tuesday
	- meeting this Wednesday
 - everyone tells what they did this week
 - we have time until Christmas but we have too many MUST haves and not enough
SHOULD and COULD haves, perhaps unequal division of requirements
 - TA suggests changing it
 - put "node" requirements in SHOULD haves
 - divide the work s.t. the must haves are done by Christmas
 - faculty accounts are okay
 - context map:
	- Wilhelm explains Resource Pools part of context map
 - we have to start coding by next week max
 - TA will send us structure of assignment(how to save and put it into gitlab)
 - sprint and example requirements on brightspace: take a look there and
get inspired
 - we need to update MAIN BRANCH every sprint( a sprint is 1 week)
 - 2 approvals per merge request

Questions by us:
 - by Friday we submit the arhitechture:
	- design patterns(if we have them but not mandatory)
	- the more we add the more feedback we get
	- UML component diagram 
	- context map(should really strive to do it by this Friday 2 Dec)
	- lollipop notation for the UML map
	- no strict requirements but it's more for us to get feedback
 - how do microservices interact with database:
	- can do 1 DB/microservice BUT
	- can do separate infrastructure connected to DB and everything is
	connected to that infrastructure
 - permissions of floating users(not assigned to a facculty)
	- CANNOT request a facculty
	- CAN put a node
		- where does the node go?
		- TA will ask whether we can decide or there is a specific way to do this
 - How does releasing resources work?
	- if GUI: you see the available dates and resources BUT we work on Postman
	so send requests to check if these resources are available
		- who sends the request?
			conclusion: - maybe they release it but exact amount isnt visible to users
			

 - big question : by wednesday means whenever before wednesday not preferred on wednesday
 - answer: long polling - for f in agenda week 3
 - IN GENERAL where do resources from nodes go - to faculty or to pool
 - when sysadmin creates a faculty assigns a certain amount, changing it later on is a COULD HAVE
 - to submit a draft: upload on gitlab and message TA that we did it


OVERALL:
 - change requirements 
 - divide work and start coding
